# Bazooka's Car Spawner
I made this while tring to learn Lua scripting for FiveM modding. If you can use it great but it's more so just a showcase of my learning and ability to do it.

## Usage
Download the zip and unzip the file. Copy the carspawner directory into resources folder. Then add "ensure carspawner" to the server.cfg
